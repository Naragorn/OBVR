# Performance spec: people in view

Status: measured 2026-10-18, nothing built. The measurement and the harness
scenarios are in `docs/performance-profiling.md` ("Gemessen 2026-10-18");
the tester's report (a Quest 3 at 120 Hz: "stuttering like crazy" with two
NPCs talking in Jauffre's house, smooth in dialogue) in `docs/controls-spec.md`
"Beta reports of 2026-10-17".

## 1. What is known

- Seven people before the player cost about 4.3 ms of CPU per eye pass on
  the developer's machine (Linux, Proton, 75 Hz): scene_pass 0.70 ms a pass
  empty, 4.3 to 5.1 ms with them; the idle before the compositor fell from
  10 ms to 2 ms; 4 to 6 % of frames dropped to the next vsync.
- OBVR's own share is small: the bone lock 0.056 ms a pass (its own span,
  `bone_lock`), the frame-end work 0.6 ms a frame unchanged. The time is the
  engine's own render of each person - bone palettes and draws, under DXVK -
  which the dual pass runs twice a frame. About 0.6 ms a person and eye.
- At 120 Hz (8.3 ms a frame) two or three people reach the budget. A Quest
  user over Virtual Desktop at 72 or 90 Hz has more room, not much.
- Interiors can be over budget on their own: Weynon Priory's house sits at
  two vsync periods (26.7 ms) with nobody in it, scene_pass 7 ms a pass with
  322 draws; what makes that cell dear is unmeasured (its lights are the
  first guess).

## 2. The three levers

1. **Alternate eye rendering** (`Render.Stereo=aer`, exists). Each frame
   renders one eye; the other eye shows its last frame reprojected. Halves
   the per-frame cost of everything in the scene passes, people included.
   Cost: none to try - the setting is there; a tester can switch it in
   OBVR.ini. Risk: the feel of it in the headset (each eye at half the rate;
   fast head turns and fast hands may show it), untested since the dual pass
   became the default. Test: the tester's own session in the house with
   `aer` against `dual`, and the capture with `StartAfterSeconds`.
2. **The second pass spared what the first already did.** The engine's
   scene render repeats per eye the work that does not depend on the eye:
   skinning palettes (the same bones, the same pose), culling (OBVR already
   replays the first eye's culling on the second, `Culling sync`), shadow
   and reflection sub-passes. Caching the first eye's palette uploads and
   answering the second eye's from the cache would take the people's share
   off the second pass. Cost: large - the palette upload path is hooked
   (`HookedSetVsConstantF`), but which uploads are eye-independent has to be
   proven per shader class, a wrong cache is the skinning collapse of
   2026-08 all over again (`obvr-skinning-kollaps-geloest`), and the gain is
   at most the second pass's people share (about 4 ms of the 8.6 here).
   Test: the hall scenario's scene_pass per pass with and without.
3. **The engine's cost per person is vanilla.** Oblivion's own CPU cost for
   a visible NPC is not OBVR's to cut; what remains is the player's: fewer
   people in view, a faster CPU, the game's own settings (actor shadows are
   off already in the tested INI). Cost: none; it is the honest answer when
   1 and 2 are not enough. What could still be measured: whether DXVK's
   constant-upload path makes the engine's palette uploads dearer than on
   native D3D9 (the tester plays on Windows, where OBVR recommends DXVK too)
   - a capture on Windows with and without DXVK, medium.

## 3. Open

- The tester's own capture of the house scene (`[Performance] Enabled=1`,
  `StartAfterSeconds=90`), to see his numbers rather than this machine's.
  **His first capture read 2026-10-18 evening** (OBVR-performance-1.zip, 60 s,
  2285 frames, no GPU samples): 44 s of a mode the export calls unknown at a
  flat 30 frames a second (the main menu and the load, most likely), 10 s of
  a menu at 85 to 90, and only the last 2.3 s in the world (188 dual-pass
  frames) - the scene he complained about is not in it. Those 188 frames say
  what a frame costs him though: scene_pass 4.14 ms a pass median, 8.6 ms a
  frame for both eyes (this machine's hall with seven people: 4.3 to 5.1 a
  pass), poses_wait and interop_held 1.5 ms mean but 10 ms on every other
  frame, frames 11 to 13 ms apart with every tenth at 21 to 22 - the engine's
  own render of the people in view, twice, over the headset's budget, the
  compositor dropping frames. The lever stands: `Stereo=aer` halves the
  scene cost; and a capture with `StartAfterSeconds` that reaches the scene.
  **His answer the same evening:** no aer for him; the test ran at 90 Hz
  (11.1 ms a frame), which his 11 to 13 ms frames miss by a little - the
  Quest 3 also offers 72 and 80 Hz (Meta's developer table: 72, 80, 90,
  120), and at 72 (13.9 ms) those frames would fit; the places he names are
  the siege of Kvatch and the view at the tower in the first Oblivion gate,
  both far heavier in actors and effects than the house; his machine an RTX
  5070 Ti, a 9800X3D, 32 GB - the GPU is not the suspect, the engine's
  single thread drawing everything twice is. GPU times cannot come from the
  capture under DXVK (`GpuTiming` reads host nanoseconds, docs/performance-
  profiling.md 2026-10-06); SteamVR's advanced frame timing or fpsVR show
  them. Asked of him: a capture at Kvatch with `StartAfterSeconds`, and a
  look at SteamVR's frame timing there to see which side is at the limit.
- The interior's own cost (lever 0, so to speak): why the house takes 7 ms a
  pass with 322 draws where the hall takes 0.7 ms with 322.
- The auto vanity camera circles the player after a while without input, in
  Full VR too (found by these runs; `open-questions-and-known-issues.md`).
  **Built 2026-10-18:** `game/VanityCamera.h` resets the engine's idle clock
  (the float at 0x00B3BB08, read off the camera update at 0x00673303) every
  frame while the headset is there, unless `[Look] AutoVanityCamera=1`; the
  setting the scripts tried to raise, `fAutoVanityModeDelay`, is Skyrim's
  name - Oblivion's is `fVanityModeAutoDelay` (the console line did nothing).
